## 🚀 Features Demonstrated

### 1. Automated Exports
Every day at 10 PM EST, this workflow automatically:
- Downloads trading data from IBKR via Flex Web Service
- Processes and organizes trades by date
- Calculates P&L and performance metrics
- Commits to Git for version control

### 2. Data Structure
```
exports/
├── daily/          # Daily trade data
│   └── 2025-07-27.json
├── weekly/         # Weekly summaries
│   └── 2025-W30.json
└── monthly/        # Monthly reports
    └── 2025-07.json
```

### 3. Cost Basis Filtering
This example filters only algorithmic trades with cost basis between $0-$50, perfect for:
- Small position algorithmic trading
- Scalping strategies
- Testing new algorithms with limited risk
